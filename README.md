## Game Hub (Programming with Mosh)

GameHub is an web application designed for discovering video games, assisting users in locating fresh and captivating titles to enjoy. With GameHub, you have the capability to search for games based on factors such as platform, genre, and additional criteria.

This is one of the first few projects that I've build using **React.js** and **Typescript** by following Mosh Hamedani's Ultimate React course on youtube.

## Installation

To get started with GameHub, follow these steps:

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Run npm install to install the required dependencies.
- Get a RAWG API key at https://rawg.io/apidocs. 
- You'll have to create an account first.
- Add the API key to src/services/api-client.ts
- Run npm run dev to start the web server.
